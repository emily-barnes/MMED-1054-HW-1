<h4>Hi! My name is Emily Barnes and I live just outside of London, ON.</h4>
<h4>I have 2 younger brothers, a cat, and a dog. I work at a brewery in London!</h4>
<h4>I play piano, and have recently started making natural soy wax candles using essential oils!</h4>
<h4>Last year I attended Laurier University, however I decided to make the switch to Fanshawe and so far I am loving it!</h4>

<h4>This is me and my dog, Cuda</h4>

<h4>I'm very excited to be in the Interactive Media Design Program. Some things are trickier than others but we just started so I know it may take some time. I love the creative aspect of it, the coding might take me awhile to figure out. However, I love feedback and I'm wanting to learn, so I think it should be a good two years!</h4>
